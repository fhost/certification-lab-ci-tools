# The Certification `toolbox` package

## Introduction

The `toolbox` package offers Python implementations for a range of tasks
commonly performed within certification testing workflows, such as
testing whether a remote device is accessible, installing deb and snap
packages on a remote device and deploying Checkbox.

It provides a clean, modular, extensible and testable alternative to the
corresponding bash "scriptlets".

## Core Concepts

The `toolbox` package is built around two fundamental abstractions:
_devices_ and _interfaces_.

### Devices

A _device_ represents a machine and is essentially the abstraction that
allows you to run commands on the machine.

There are different types of devices:
- `LocalHost` represents the machine running the script
- `RemoteDevice` represents a remote device where commands can be executed
  over SSH
- `LabDevice` is a remote device configured specifically for access in the
  way Canonical lab devices are accessed (usually through a Testflinger agent)

#### Code Examples

```python
from toolbox.devices import LocalHost

device = LocalHost()
device.run(["uname", "-r"])
```

```python
from toolbox.devices.lab import LabDevice

# the DEVICE_IP environment variable needs to be set
device = LabDevice()
device.run(["uname", "-r"])
```

You can try reserving a lab device through Testflinger and exporting `DEVICE_IP`
to the IP of the machine you have reserved. This piece of code should allow
you to execute commands on the reserved device.

#### Under the hood

The unifying view of "devices" on which commands can be executed is made
possible through the use of the `fabric` package, along with its
dependencies, i.e. `invoke` and `paramiko`.

Running commands locally doesn't directly involve using `subprocess` and
running commands remotely doesn't involve dealing with how that is
achieved over SSH. There is now a unified pattern for both.


### Interfaces

A device _interface_ is a modular group of (related) operations that can be
performed on a device. When a device instance is created, a set of device
_interfaces_ are attached to it, thus defining the operations that can be
performed on the device.

Examples of interfaces:
- `RebootInterface`: reboot the device or check if a reboot is required
- `SystemStatusInterface`: check the (systemd) status of the device and
  wait until it reaches an allowed state
- `SnapdAPIClient`: interact with snapd REST API on the device
- `DebInterface`: manage Debian packages (install, add repositories, check
  for operations in progress)
- `SnapInterface`: manage snap packages (install/refresh, check for operations
  in progress)

#### Code example: query the snapd API

```python
from toolbox.devices.lab import LabDevice
from toolbox.interfaces.snapd import SnapdAPIClient

# the DEVICE_IP environment variable needs to be set
device = LabDevice(interfaces=[SnapdAPIClient()])

device.interfaces[SnapdAPIClient].get("system-info")
device.interfaces[SnapdAPIClient].get("connections", params={"select": "all"})
# returned as JSON, even though content-type is application/x.ubuntu.assertion
device.interfaces[SnapdAPIClient].get("model")
```

#### Code example: update/upgrade Debian packages

```python
from toolbox.devices.lab import LabDevice
from toolbox.interfaces.debs import DebInterface
from toolbox.interfaces.reboot import RebootInterface
from toolbox.interfaces.status import SystemStatusInterface

# the DEVICE_IP environment variable needs to be set
device = LabDevice(
    interfaces=[DebInterface(), RebootInterface(), SystemStatusInterface()]
)

device.interfaces[DebInterface].update()
device.interfaces[DebInterface].upgrade()
device.interfaces[DebInterface].wait_for_complete()
device.interfaces[RebootInterface].reboot()
device.interfaces[SystemStatusInterface].wait_for_status(allowed=["degraded"])
```

#### Code example: install/refresh a snap

```python
from toolbox.devices.lab import LabDevice
from toolbox.entities.snaps import SnapSpecifier
from toolbox.interfaces.reboot import RebootInterface
from toolbox.interfaces.snaps import SnapInterface
from toolbox.interfaces.snapd import SnapdAPIClient
from toolbox.interfaces.status import SystemStatusInterface

# the DEVICE_IP environment variable needs to be set
device = LabDevice(
    interfaces=[
        RebootInterface(),
        SnapdAPIClient(),
        SystemStatusInterface(),
        SnapInterface(),
    ]
)

device.interfaces[SnapInterface].install(
    "bluez", channel="latest/beta", options=["--devmode"], refresh_ok=True
)
```

Note that only the `SnapInterface` is actually used here, but this is a
complex interface that actually requires the three additional interfaces
that were attached to the device. If only the `SnapInterface` had been
attached then an error would have been raised, indicating which required
interfaces are missing.

## Deploying Checkbox

In Certification tests, Checkbox is installed on a remote device (either
through Debian packages or snaps) and also on the "agent" controlling
the device (from a matching version of the source).

Checkbox deployment is complex and, importantly, cannot be performed
through a single device interface since it spans both a device and
its agent.

The `toolbox` offers Checkbox installer classes for deploying Checkbox
through Debian and snap packages, with their common functionality implemented
in a base class.

#### Code example: install Checkbox from debs (only on the device)

```python
from toolbox.checkbox.installers.debs import CheckboxDebsInstaller
from toolbox.devices import LocalHost
from toolbox.devices.lab import LabDevice
from toolbox.entities.risk import Risk
from toolbox.interfaces.debs import DebInterface

# the DEVICE_IP environment variable needs to be set
device = LabDevice(interfaces=[DebInterface()])

installer = CheckboxDebsInstaller(device, agent=LocalHost(), risk=Risk.BETA)
installer.install_on_device()
```

#### Code example: install Checkbox from snaps (on the device)

```python
from snapstore.client import SnapstoreClient
from snapstore.craft import create_base_client
from toolbox.checkbox.installers.snaps import (
    CheckboxSnapsInstaller,
    TOKEN_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE,
)
from toolbox.devices import LocalHost
from toolbox.devices.lab import LabDevice
from toolbox.entities.snaps import SnapSpecifier
from toolbox.interfaces.reboot import RebootInterface
from toolbox.interfaces.snaps import SnapInterface
from toolbox.interfaces.snapd import SnapdAPIClient
from toolbox.interfaces.status import SystemStatusInterface

# the DEVICE_IP environment variable needs to be set
device = LabDevice(
    interfaces=[
        SystemStatusInterface(),
        RebootInterface(),
        SnapdAPIClient(),
        SnapInterface(),
    ]
)
# the UBUNTU_STORE_AUTH environment variable needs to be set
installer = CheckboxSnapsInstaller(
    device=device,
    agent=LocalHost(),
    frontends=[SnapSpecifier.from_string("checkbox-private-frontend=uc24/beta")],
    snapstore=SnapstoreClient(create_base_client(TOKEN_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE)),
)
# this will also install Checkbox on the agent, from source
installer.install()
```

## CLI scripts

The modules in `toolbox.cli` offer entry points for command-line scripts that
can gradually replace the bash "scriptlets". The `pyproject.toml` file specifies
the link between the command-line scripts that will be installed along with
the `toolbox` package and the corresponding entry points:

```
[project.scripts]
wait-for-ssh = "toolbox.cli.wait_for_ssh:main"
wait-for-packages-complete = "toolbox.cli.wait_for_packages_complete:main"
wait-for-snap-changes = "toolbox.cli.wait_for_snap_changes:main"
watch-checkbox-agent = "toolbox.cli.watch_checkbox_agent:main"
install-checkbox-snaps = "toolbox.cli.install_checkbox_snaps:main"
install-checkbox-debs = "toolbox.cli.install_checkbox_debs:main"
ensure-stable-snaps = "toolbox.cli.ensure_stable_snaps:main"
ensure-kernel = "toolbox.cli.ensure_kernel:main"
setup_apt_cache_proxy = "toolbox.cli.setup_apt_cache_proxy:main"
```

### `watch-checkbox-agent`

Monitors the latest journal entry timestamp of `snap.checkbox.agent.service` on
the device under test over SSH. If the latest timestamp is older than the
configured timeout, it executes a caller-specified command locally on the
agent and enters recovery mode. In recovery mode, the script waits up to
`--recovery-timeout` seconds for a newer timestamp to appear; if none appears,
it exits with a failure status. If a newer timestamp appears in time, it
returns to normal monitoring mode. Timeout checks are based only on local time,
while the journal timestamp value is used only to detect whether new input has
appeared. SSH failures are treated as transient: the script waits and retries.

```bash
# DEVICE_IP (and optionally DEVICE_USER / DEVICE_PWD) must be set
watch-checkbox-agent --timeout 300 --recovery-timeout 120 --delay 30 --command "echo recover"
```

### `ensure-kernel`

Verifies that the device under test booted the expected kernel version (e.g.
after installing a kernel from -proposed). It reads `/proc/version_signature`
from the device over SSH (using a `LabDevice`, so the `DEVICE_IP`, `DEVICE_USER`
and `DEVICE_PWD` environment variables configure the connection) and compares
the booted version against the expected one. It exits with a non-zero status
when the booted version cannot be determined or does not match, so the caller
can fail the job.

```bash
# DEVICE_IP (and optionally DEVICE_USER / DEVICE_PWD) must be set
ensure-kernel 6.8.0-130.130
```

### `setup_apt_cache_proxy`

Configures the device under test to route APT HTTP traffic through the
lab apt-cache proxy (default: `tel-apt-cache.canonical.com:3142`) while
keeping HTTPS traffic `DIRECT`. Ubuntu Core devices are skipped (no apt).
All error paths exit 0 with a descriptive SKIP/ERROR message so that SRU
tests are not aborted. The `DEVICE_IP` (and optionally `DEVICE_USER` /
`DEVICE_PWD`) environment variables configure the SSH connection. The
`APT_CACHE_HOST` environment variable can override the default cache host.

```bash
# DEVICE_IP (and optionally DEVICE_USER / DEVICE_PWD) must be set
DEVICE_IP=<dut-ip> setup_apt_cache_proxy

# Custom cache host
APT_CACHE_HOST=<host> DEVICE_IP=<dut-ip> setup_apt_cache_proxy
```

## Testing locally with `multipass`

Apart from the package's unit tests, it is possible to perform manual
integration tests using `multipass` instances (i.e. lightweight VMs) as
remote devices. In the future, this could also serve as the basis of
automated integration tests.

Launch a named instance for any image you'd like to test with
(e.g. `noble`, `core22`, etc.):
```
IMAGE=core20
DEVICE=device-$IMAGE
multipass launch $IMAGE --name $DEVICE --disk 10GB
```

Set the instance up so that it can accept password-less SSH connections.
You only need to perform this step once for a new image.
```
echo "ubuntu:insecure" | multipass exec $DEVICE -- sudo chpasswd
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/$DEVICE-key -N "" -C "temporary-$DEVICE-key"
cat ~/.ssh/$DEVICE-key.pub | multipass exec $DEVICE -- bash -c "cat >> /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Now you can set the `DEVICE_IP` environment variable to point to the
instance's IP. Every time you create `LabDevice`, it will refer to this
specific instance.
```
export DEVICE_IP=$(multipass exec $DEVICE -- hostname -I | tr -d '[:space:]')
```

Run `poetry run python` from `cert-tools/toolbox` in order to launch a Python
interactive shell in a virtual environment where `toolbox` is installed.
Now you can manually perform tests with `toolbox`, treating the `multipass`
instance as the remote device:

```python
from toolbox.devices.lab import LabDevice

device = LabDevice()
device.run(["uname", "-n"])
```
This should output `device-core20`.
